## Ways to help

- **Report a bug** with the [bug report form](https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
  Steps to reproduce are the most useful thing you can give us.
- **Suggest a feature** with the [feature request form](https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
- **Answer questions** in [Discussions](https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes/discussions).
- **Improve the docs.** Every docs page has an "Edit this page on GitHub" link.
- **Write code**: start with a [good first issue](#pick-a-first-issue).
- **Build a plugin** and share it in the community registry.

## Set up your machine

You need:

- [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org) (the version is in `.nvmrc`, so `nvm use` works)
- pnpm 11, installed by Corepack
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes.git
cd Tessera-Notes
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` starts the web app (hot reload) and the sync server together — the app proxies `/api`
and `/sync` to the server — and prints the web app's address.

### Everyday commands

| Command                      | Does                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`                   | The web app and the sync server together, with hot reload.    |
| `pnpm test`                  | Every unit test (Vitest).                                     |
| `pnpm test:e2e`              | End-to-end tests (Playwright, Chromium and Firefox) against a production build. |
| `pnpm test:e2e:install`      | Installs the Playwright browsers (once per machine).          |
| `pnpm typecheck`             | Type-checks every package.                                    |
| `pnpm lint`                  | ESLint and Prettier. `pnpm lint:fix` fixes what it can.       |
| `pnpm build`                 | Builds every package and app.                                 |
| `pnpm screenshots e2e/<area>` | Regenerates the screenshots for one area.                    |

Run one package with `pnpm --filter @tessera/<name> <script>`, for example
`pnpm --filter @tessera/editor test`. Run one area's end-to-end tests with
`pnpm test:e2e e2e/<area>`; add `E2E_DEV=1` to test against the dev server instead of a build.

### The server alone, and the desktop app

`pnpm dev` already runs the server next to the web app. Run the server alone (with a particular
`DATA_DIR`, for example), or the desktop app, with:

```bash
DATA_DIR=./data pnpm --filter @tessera/server dev   # the sync server, alone
pnpm --filter @tessera/desktop dev:app              # the desktop app (needs Rust, see below)
```

The desktop app is built with [Tauri 2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). Install Rust
and your platform's prerequisites from that page first.

### The docs site

```bash
pnpm --dir docs install
pnpm --dir docs dev
```

```

A few ideas make the codebase easy to work in:

- **`packages/core` is the contract.** Types, the document schema, service interfaces and the
  runtime live there. Everything else builds on it. Read [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the details and
  the [architecture guide](https://femboypuppy.github.io/Tessera-Notes/contributing/architecture) for
  the overview.
- **Features plug in; they don't patch.** Each feature registers routes, commands, panels, blocks
  and services through one `FeatureModule` in `apps/web/src/features/<area>/index.ts`. The code
  lives in the feature's package.
- **Document state lives in Yjs.** Never copy document content into React state; read it through
  the helpers in `packages/core`.
- **Packages don't import each other**, except `core`, `ui`, and a couple of natural pairs
  (`importers` → `markdown`, `plugins` → `plugin-api`). That keeps features independent.

## Pick a first issue

1. Browse [`good first issue`](https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
   Each one says what to change, where, and how to check it works.
2. Comment "I'd like to take this" so nobody else starts on it. A maintainer assigns it to you.
3. Stuck? Ask in the issue. Questions are welcome; there are no silly ones.

For anything bigger than a small fix, open a
[discussion](https://github.com/femboypuppy/Tessera-Notes/discussions) or an issue first, so we can agree
on the approach before you spend time on code.

## Make a change

1. Fork the repository and create a branch: `git switch -c fix/palette-empty-state`.
2. Make your change, with tests.
3. Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`, and the end-to-end tests for the area you
   touched.
4. Push and open a pull request. Fill in the template.

### Standards

- **TypeScript strict.** No `any` (use `unknown` and narrow). No `@ts-ignore`; an
  `eslint-disable` needs a comment saying why.
- **Tests test behavior.** Vitest next to the code (`*.test.ts`), Playwright for user flows in
  `e2e/<area>/`. Never skip or weaken a test to make it pass.
- **UI** uses components and tokens from `packages/ui`, works in light and dark themes and at phone
  width, is fully keyboard-accessible, and respects reduced motion.
- **Every user-facing string goes through `t()`**, so it can be translated.
- **Async UI** has loading, empty and error states. Destructive actions are undoable or confirmed.
- **Security:** sanitize external HTML with DOMPurify, validate untrusted data with zod, never use
  `eval` or `new Function`.
- **Performance:** load heavy code with dynamic `import()`, and stay within the budgets in
  [SPEC.md](SPEC.md#10-performance-budgets).
- **Dependencies:** prefer what's already installed. A new one must be small, maintained,
  MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD/ISC-licensed, and pinned to an exact version. Say why in the PR.

## Commit messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). The release changelog is
generated from them.

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <what changed, in the imperative>
```

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`.
- **Scope:** the area, such as `editor`, `sync`, `databases`, `search`, `plugins`, `desktop`,
  `importers`, `core`, `ui`, `web`, `server` or `docs`.

Examples:

```txt
feat(editor): add a copy button to code blocks
fix(sync): retry uploads after a quota error
docs(self-hosting): explain SIGNUP_MODE
```

Small, focused commits are easier to review than one large one.

## Pull request checklist

Before you ask for a review:

- [ ] The PR does one thing, and its description says what and why (with screenshots for UI).
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` pass locally.
- [ ] New behavior has tests; bug fixes have a test that failed before the fix.
- [ ] UI changes work in light and dark themes, at phone width, and with the keyboard alone.
- [ ] User-facing strings go through `t()`.
- [ ] Docs are updated if behavior changed.
- [ ] Commits follow the convention above.

A maintainer reviews every pull request, usually within a few days. We may suggest changes; that's
normal and not a judgment of your work.

## Write a plugin

Plugins are the easiest way to add something to Tessera without changing its core. They run in a
sandbox, declare the permissions they need, and use a small typed SDK.

```bash
pnpm create tessera-plugin my-plugin
cd my-plugin
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The scaffold includes a manifest, source, a build, and tests with a mocked API. Then:

1. Load your plugin in Tessera from **Settings → Plugins** in dev mode, with live reload.
2. Read the plugin guide and API reference in the
   [docs](https://femboypuppy.github.io/Tessera-Notes/plugins/).
3. Look at the example plugins in [`examples/`](examples) for patterns.
4. Publish it to the community registry when it's ready.
