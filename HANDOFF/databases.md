# Databases handoff

## Plan

Milestones from `agents/04-databases.md`, each ending tested and committed on `feat/databases`:

1. **M1: query engine** (`packages/db-views/src/query`, pure TypeScript, no React, no Yjs):
   fast cell reading equivalent to core's `getCellValue`, a compiled filter tree (every operator of
   every property type, nested AND/OR, dates by calendar day in the viewer's time zone, relative
   dates), stable multi-level sorting with `Intl.Collator`, grouping (options, checkbox, date
   buckets, empty group, explicit order, hidden and collapsed), every summary kind, full-text search
   inside a database, value formatting, type conversion and CSV parsing and inference. At least 95%
   coverage, and a performance test (10,000 rows filtered in under 50 ms).
2. **M2: databases and the table view.** A framework-free `DatabaseStore` (incremental snapshot of a
   database doc joined with page metadata, read through `useSyncExternalStore`, never mirrored into
   React state); `pageBodies.database`; the `database` embed renderer with "Database – inline" and
   "Linked view of database" slash items; row properties in `pageTopSections`; every property type
   with its cell renderer and editor; a virtualized ARIA grid with spreadsheet keyboard navigation,
   range selection, copy and paste; the column header menu (rename, type change with conversion,
   hide, sort, filter, resize, drag reorder, delete); row actions (open, side peek, duplicate,
   delete); summary footer; two-way relations kept consistent on trash and permanent deletion.
3. **M3: more views.** View tabs (create, rename, duplicate, reorder, delete, change layout); board
   (drag cards within and across groups, add, collapse and hide groups); calendar (month and week,
   drag to reschedule, drag an edge to resize, click a day to create, "No date" tray); gallery
   (small, medium, large cards with covers); list; the keyboard-first filter and sort builder with
   chips.
4. **M4: power features.** CSV import with type inference and export of the current view; row
   templates; search inside a database; grouping in the table; frozen first column; undo toasts
   for deleting rows, properties and views. Stretch, only after everything else passes: formulas.

After each milestone: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test`, the e2e specs in `e2e/databases`,
screenshots, a critical look, a commit.

## Built (what exists and where)

Everything lives in `packages/db-views` (`@tessera/db-views`); `apps/web/src/features/databases`
only registers it. Subpath exports keep the shell's startup bundle small: `.` (light: overlay
store, sidebar button, `tCore` strings), `./query`, `./csv`, `./operations`, `./database-body`,
`./row-properties`, `./linked-from`, `./inline-database`, `./actions`.

**Query engine** (`src/query`: pure TypeScript, no React, no Yjs; reusable by search, plugins and
exports through `@tessera/db-views/query`)

- `cells.ts`: reads stored values with fast validators equivalent to core's zod schemas
  (`cells.test.ts` proves the equivalence with fast-check); parsed dates are cached per value.
- `filter.ts`: compiles a filter tree once (nested AND/OR, every operator of every property type,
  inactive rules ignored) into a predicate. `filter-edit.ts`: immutable tree edits for the builder.
- `dates.ts`: day keys, time zones (zone offsets cached by quarter hour, DST safe), ISO weeks,
  relative dates ("today", "next 7 days", "this month", past or next N days, weeks, months, years),
  ranges.
- `sort.ts`: stable multi-level sorting with `Intl.Collator` (numeric), empty values last,
  composite `Float64Array` keys for speed. `group.ts`: groups by option, checkbox, date bucket
  (day, week, month, year), number, text or relation, with custom order and hidden, collapsed and
  empty groups.
- `summary.ts`: count all, empty, not empty, unique, percent empty and not empty, sum, average,
  median, min, max, range, checked, unchecked, percent checked and unchecked, earliest date,
  latest date, date range. `search.ts`: accent- and case-insensitive search over searchable cells.
- `format.ts` (display text, and plain text for CSV and the clipboard), `parse.ts` (text to
  values: numbers with currencies and percents, dates and ranges, booleans, URLs, emails, option
  names), `convert.ts` (value conversion for type changes), `defaults.ts` (values a new row needs
  to match the view's filter or its group), `run.ts` (`runQuery`: filter, search, sort, group,
  summaries).
- `formula/`: formulas, a small and safe expression language (see below).
- Tests: `src/query/**/*.test.ts`, 156 tests: 98.74% statements, 95.92% branches, 99.74%
  functions, 99.33% lines (`pnpm --filter @tessera/db-views test:coverage` fails below 95%).
  `perf.test.ts`: filtering 10,000 rows < 50 ms; filtering, searching and sorting a whole view
  < 100 ms.

**Formulas** (`src/query/formula`, the stretch goal; pure TypeScript, no `eval`)

- `tokens.ts` (tokenizer with positions; straight and curly quotes), `parse.ts` (Pratt parser:
  `? :`, `or`/`||`, `and`/`&&`, `==`/`=`/`!=`, comparisons, `+ - * / % ^`, `not`/`!`, calls,
  `prop("Name")`; limits on nesting and tree depth), `compile.ts` (checks functions, argument
  counts and property names; `renamePropertyInFormula`), `evaluate.ts` (the evaluator, with a step
  budget, a text-size limit and loop detection between formulas), `functions.ts` (44 functions:
  logic, math, text and dates with units, time zones and DST), `rows.ts` (`withFormulaValues`:
  results per row in `row.formulas`, cached per row object so memoized rows keep their identity;
  `previewFormula` for the editor).
- `runQuery` computes formulas first, so filters (by the result's kind), sorts, search, summaries
  (including sum, average, median, min, max and range of numeric results), CSV export and the
  clipboard read them like any cell.
- UI: `ui/formula-dialog.tsx` (live errors with their position, a preview of the first rows,
  properties and functions to insert, Ctrl or ⌘ + Enter to save). It opens when a formula
  property is added, from "Edit formula" in the column menu or the row properties, from Enter or a
  double-click on a formula cell, and after changing a property's type to Formula.

**Model** (`src/model`)

- `store.ts`: `DatabaseStore`, an incremental snapshot of a database doc joined with the page
  store (stable row objects; only changed rows are rebuilt), read through `useSyncExternalStore`.
  Document state is never mirrored into React state.
- `operations.ts`: create databases; add, duplicate and trash rows (row templates are copied into
  new rows); write cells (titles rename the row page, relations stay two-way); paste text into
  ranges; add, duplicate, retype (with conversion and undo) and delete properties and options;
  views (setup for boards and calendars, visibility, order, widths); `renameProperty` also
  rewrites the formulas that read the property.
- `relations.ts`: two-way relations (both sides written together, unlinking, cleanup after a
  permanent deletion). `back-references.ts`: the index behind "Linked from" on target pages.
- `undo.ts`: `runUndoable` wraps a destructive action in a `Y.UndoManager` scoped to its own
  origin; the toast's Undo reverts exactly that action for two minutes.
- `csv-import.ts`: a database from a parsed CSV file. `bulk.ts`: bulk row creation (see Contract
  change request 1).

**UI** (`src/ui`: React, `@tessera/ui` components and tokens, Radix primitives, strings through
`t()` from `src/i18n`)

- `database-view.tsx`: loading, error, missing and trashed states, view tabs, toolbar, filter
  chips and the active layout, for database pages and inline embeds.
- `table/`: a virtualized ARIA grid (`aria-activedescendant`; 10,000 rows at 60 fps) with
  spreadsheet keyboard navigation, range selection, copy, cut and paste (TSV and HTML),
  Mod+Enter, the column header menu (rename, change type, hide, sort, filter, group, insert, move,
  delete, edit options), drag to reorder and resize columns, a frozen first column, grouping, row
  actions (open as page, side peek, add below, duplicate, delete) and the summary footer.
- `cells/`: display and editors per type (text, number, select and multi-select with create by
  typing, date and range with time and time zone, relation picker with search, checkbox, URL,
  email, created and edited times).
- `board/`, `calendar/`, `gallery/`, `list/`: the other layouts (drag and drop with dnd-kit, with
  keyboard alternatives); `cards/card.tsx` is shared by board and gallery.
- `toolbar/`: the filter builder, the sort builder, the properties panel and the filter chips.
- `view-tabs.tsx`, `options-dialog.tsx`, `property-menu.tsx`, `row-properties.tsx` (properties
  above a row page's body), `side-peek.tsx`, `linked-from.tsx`, `csv/import-dialog.tsx`,
  `csv/export-item.tsx`, `database-picker.tsx` (linked views).

**Tests**

- Unit and component: 213 tests in `packages/db-views` (query, formulas, model, CSV, grid
  navigation and clipboard, board and calendar logic, the formula editor) and 4 integration tests
  in
  `apps/web/src/features/databases/databases.test.tsx` (registration; the slash item inserting an
  inline database that is then edited in place; the missing-database state; relation cleanup).
- e2e (`e2e/databases`, Chromium and Firefox): `table.spec.ts` (every property type, 20 rows,
  value display, copy, filter, sort, keyboard editing, delete with undo), `views.spec.ts` (a board
  drag changes the value, calendar reschedule and resize, "No date" tray), `csv.spec.ts` (export
  compared with the view, import with inferred types), `formula.spec.ts` (add a formula, errors,
  inserting from the lists, preview, save, sort and filter by it, rename the property it reads),
  `inline.spec.ts` (needs the editor, see Known gaps), `perf.spec.ts` (10,000 rows stay
  virtualized and scroll at 60 fps, Chromium).
- Screenshots: `e2e/databases/databases.screenshots.ts`.

## How it plugs in (FeatureModule entries, services, extension points used)

`apps/web/src/features/databases/index.ts` (`databasesFeature`):

- `pageBodies.database`: `DatabaseBody` (lazy). It registers a focus handler, so Enter in the
  page title moves focus into the active view.
- `pageTopSections`: `databases.rowProperties` (order 0, row pages only) and
  `databases.linkedFrom` (order 10, pages that relations point at).
- `blockRenderers`: kind `database` (`InlineDatabase`, lazy). Embed attributes: `ref` = the
  database page ID, `data` = `{ viewId }` (the view the embed shows). Slash items
  `databases.inline` ("Database – inline": creates a database under the current page) and
  `databases.linked` ("Linked view of database": opens a database picker).
- `sidebarSections`: `databases.new` (top): "New database" and "Import CSV as database".
- `overlays`: `databases.overlays`: side peek, CSV import dialog, database picker.
- `commands`: `databases.newDatabase`, `databases.importCsv`, `databases.exportCsv` (database pages
  only).
- `activate`: on `page.deleted` (local only), removes dangling relation values; on
  `database.changed`, refreshes the "Linked from" index; its cleanup resets the overlays.

Also used: `ctx.workspace` (pages, `createDatabase`, `addDatabaseRow`, trash and restore),
`loadDatabaseDoc` and `loadPageDoc`, core's database helpers, `ctx.settings.device`
(`databases.view.<databaseId>`: the view a database page shows on this device),
`ctx.services.assetStore` (card covers), `ctx.toast`, `ctx.confirm`, the `navigation.changed`
event and `COMMANDS.focusTitle` (focus a new database's title), `ctx.navigate`.

## Decisions (and why)

1. **Own grid instead of `@tanstack/react-table`** (listed in SPEC 13): the table needs an ARIA
   grid with `aria-activedescendant`, range selection, a frozen column and a custom virtualized
   body. react-table added nothing we used, so it was removed from `package.json`.
   `@tanstack/react-virtual` does the virtualization.
2. **Scrolling at 60 fps**: the virtualizer lives in `TableBody`, so a scroll re-renders only the
   body, not the header (dnd-kit sortables), the footer or the menus. Rows are memoized with
   primitive props, and their hover buttons mount only on the hovered row. Measured on the
   production build while scrolling 7,200 px/s: median and p95 frame times of 16.7 ms (before:
   33 ms; 67 ms on the dev build).
3. **Fast cell validation** equivalent to core's zod schemas: zod per cell was too slow for
   10,000 rows. Property-based tests keep the two in step.
4. **Dates**: date-only values are calendar days; date-times are instants, shown and compared as
   days in the viewer's time zone (or the value's own zone when it has one). Relative filters
   resolve against today in the viewer's zone; weeks start on the view's setting (Monday by
   default).
5. **Sorting**: `Intl.Collator` with numeric collation in the display locale; empty values last
   in both directions (as in Notion); ties keep the manual row order (stable).
6. **Inactive rules are ignored**: a filter rule without a value yet (just added) doesn't hide
   every row, and a group whose rules are all inactive is ignored. Chips mark such rules as
   inactive.
7. **Rows are pages**: values live in the database doc and only bodies in page docs, so views
   never load row pages. Gallery content covers are the one exception: a card reads its row page
   only once it scrolls into view, one at a time, cached by `updatedAt`.
8. **Undo**: destructive actions (deleting rows, properties, options and views; type changes) run
   in a `Y.UndoManager` with a unique origin, so the toast's Undo reverts that action only, even
   after other edits. Deleting rows moves them to the trash (Undo restores them).
9. **Relations**: two-way relations are written on both sides in one action. After a permanent
   deletion only the client that deleted cleans up (the edits sync), so peers never race.
   Trashed targets are hidden in cells and come back on restore, because their IDs are kept.
10. **Active view per device** (`databases.view.<id>`), like a personal preference, rather than a
    synced setting: two people can look at different views of the same database page. Inline
    embeds keep their view in the block's `data`, so it travels with the page.
11. **Full-width database pages** (a page prop set at creation), since tables need the room.
12. **CSV**: papaparse parses (RFC 4180, delimiter detection, BOM). Inference: checkbox (yes/no
    words), number (percent, or a single currency), date (day-first when a numeric date says so),
    URL, email, multi-select (repeated comma-separated names), select (repeated short values, or
    a few short labels in a small file), else text. Export writes plain text (option names,
    `YYYY-MM-DD` dates, Yes/No, page titles) with a BOM so spreadsheet apps read UTF-8.
13. **Clipboard**: copy writes TSV and an HTML table. Paste reads TSV (quoted cells), fills a
    selected range from a single cell, adds rows when the block is taller than the table, creates
    missing options and resolves relation titles. Titles are written first, so a paste can relate
    rows that it names.
14. **Week view** shows one week of day columns with the same bars as the month view (no hour
    grid): databases track due dates and spans rather than hourly schedules.
15. **Focus**: the active cell's outline shows only while focus is in the grid. Menus that open a
    rename field schedule the focus after Radix finishes closing (`useAfterMenuClose`); otherwise
    Radix takes focus back.
16. **e2e clipboard**: specs paste and copy through synthetic `ClipboardEvent`s (parallel workers
    share the system clipboard). Firefox gives untrusted events an empty `clipboardData`, so the
    helper defines the property on the event instead.
17. **The performance e2e measures in Chromium** (rAF frame times while scrolling; best of five
    runs; median < 18 ms and p95 < 34 ms). Busy CI machines get some slack without hiding a real
    regression (a table that re-renders on scroll measured 33 to 67 ms).
18. **Dependency added**: `fast-check` 4.10.2 (MIT, dev only) for the property-based tests.
19. **Formula language**: Notion-like, so it feels familiar: `prop("Name")`, `if()`, `dateAdd()`,
    `dateBetween()`. Properties read as text (title, text, URL, email; option names; relation
    titles joined with `, `), numbers, checkboxes or dates (created and edited times too). There
    are no lists: multi-selects and relations read as joined text, so `contains()` works on them.
    Empty values propagate (`prop("Pages") * 2` is empty when Pages is empty), text comparisons
    and `contains` ignore case, and `+` joins text when either side is text.
20. **Formula errors** leave the cell empty instead of showing an error code in the table; the
    editor explains the error (translated, with its position) and won't save a formula that
    doesn't compile. Per-row errors (like a division by zero) show in the editor's preview.
21. **Formula results are computed per view query and cached per row object** (keyed by the
    properties, time zone, locale and, for `now()`/`today()`, the minute), so scrolling and
    re-rendering never re-evaluate, and memoized rows keep their identity. Formulas that read
    relations are recomputed on every query, since titles of other pages can change.
22. **Formulas follow renames** (`prop("Old")` is rewritten when a property is renamed), and
    changing a formula to another type keeps its results as stored values (as in Notion).

## Contract change requests (exact proposed diff to packages/core, and why)

### CCR 1: bulk row creation

**Why.** `createPage` rebuilds the page index and `addRow` re-reads every row on each call, so
adding n rows is O(n²): 3,000 rows take about 18 s, and 10,000 take several minutes. CSV import
(and the Notion and Obsidian importers), pasting many rows and the 10,000-row performance test
need a bulk path.

**Workaround in place:** `packages/db-views/src/model/bulk.ts` writes the same structures after
the same validation (its tests in `model.test.ts` read the result back through core's readers).
When this lands, replace the body of `addRowsInBulk` with a call to
`ctx.workspace.addDatabaseRows`.

Plus: export `createPages`, `addRows` and `checkRowValues` from `packages/core/src/index.ts` (and
from the module `loadDatabaseHelpers` loads), and tests like the "addRowsInBulk" ones in
`packages/db-views/src/model/model.test.ts` (rows read back like `addDatabaseRow`'s, insertion
after a row, validation before writing, 10,000 rows well under a second).

No other core changes are needed.

## Known gaps and bugs

- Formulas have no lists or list functions (`map`, `filter`), no regular expressions (on purpose,
  for safety) and no formatting codes for `formatDate` (it uses the viewer's locale).
- `e2e/databases/perf.spec.ts` needs a CPU that isn't saturated: with every core busy (four
  browser workers plus other agents here), frames stretched to 33 ms; alone, the same build
  measured 16.7 ms. It keeps the best of five runs to ride out short bursts.
- **The inline database e2e runs only once the editor is merged.** `e2e/databases/inline.spec.ts`
  skips itself, with a message saying why, when no feature renders `page` bodies (true on this
  branch, where the editor is a stub). The same path (slash item → embed attributes → renderer →
  editing inside the embed → view choice written to the block's data) is covered on this branch by
  `apps/web/src/features/databases/databases.test.tsx`, which renders the embed the way the
  editor's embed node view does (`ctx.blocks.resolve('database')`). **Verified with the editor:**
  in a scratch worktree with `feat/editor` (07b5bdb) merged into this branch, the
  `e2e/databases` suite ran on the production build in Chromium and Firefox: 14 passed, the
  Chromium-only perf spec skipped in Firefox, and `inline.spec.ts` failed once in Chromium
  (Enter pressed before the lazily loaded editor mounted). After the spec waited for the editor,
  `inline.spec.ts` passed 6 of 6 runs (`--repeat-each=3`, both browsers).
- The 10,000-row performance e2e measures in Chromium only (frame timing is engine-specific).
- Row hover buttons ("Open", row actions) are for the mouse; keyboard users have Alt+Enter (side
  peek), the context-menu key or Shift+F10 (row actions) and the header menu. On touch screens the
  buttons appear once a row is tapped.
- Relation cleanup after a permanent deletion runs on the deleting client. If that client closes
  in the few milliseconds before the cleanup runs, dangling IDs stay in the data; cells and
  "Linked from" ignore pages that don't exist, so nothing shows.
- Pressing Escape during a closing popover's exit animation (about 150 ms) reaches the closing
  popover (Radix keeps it mounted while it animates), so a second press is needed to close the
  next one.

## Follow-ups for the merge (cross-agent wiring you couldn't finish alone)

- **Editor (02):** embeds of kind `database` render through the block registry, so there is
  nothing else to wire. After the merge, run `pnpm test:e2e e2e/databases/inline.spec.ts`; it
  should stop skipping. The spec presses Enter in the title, types `/database` and picks
  "Database – inline" (an option or a menu item).
- **Architect:** apply CCR 1, then make `addRowsInBulk` call `ctx.workspace.addDatabaseRows`.
- **Importers (08):** Notion databases can reuse `parseCsv` and `inferColumns` from
  `@tessera/db-views/csv`, `importCsvAsDatabase` (`src/model/csv-import.ts`) and `parseCellText`
  from `@tessera/db-views/query`. The markdown export can write each database as CSV with
  `rowsToCsv` (the same format as "Export view as CSV").
- **Search (05):** row titles are page titles, so they're already indexed. To index cell values,
  use `cellToText` from `@tessera/db-views/query`.
- **Plugins (06):** if plugins get read access to databases, `runQuery` from
  `@tessera/db-views/query` evaluates a view's filters, sorts and groups exactly like the UI.
- **CI (09):** run `pnpm --filter @tessera/db-views test:coverage` (it fails under 95% coverage
  of the query engine). `e2e/databases/perf.spec.ts` takes about a minute (it imports 10,000
  rows).
- **Docs (10):** screenshots below. The grid's keyboard shortcuts are in its screen-reader hint
  (`keyboardHint` in `packages/db-views/src/i18n/en.ts`).
