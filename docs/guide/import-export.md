# Import and export

Moving into Tessera takes one click, and so does moving out. Imports never touch what's already
in your workspace: everything lands under one new top-level page.

## Import

Open **Import** from the sidebar, the palette, or the first-run screen. Drop a zip or a folder, or
pick files. Tessera detects the source, shows what it found, and imports it with a progress bar.
You can cancel at any time.

### From Notion

1. In Notion, open **Settings → Workspace → Export all workspace content** (or **Export** on a
   single page).
2. Choose **Markdown & CSV**, include subpages, and download the zip. Multi-part exports are fine.
3. In Tessera, choose **Import from Notion** and drop the zip (or all the parts).

Tessera rebuilds the page tree, removes Notion's long IDs from names, turns CSV files into
databases with typed properties, rewrites internal links, and imports images and files.

### From Obsidian

Choose **Import from Obsidian** and pick your vault folder (or a zip of it).

- Folders become pages, and notes become pages inside them.
- Frontmatter becomes page properties; `tags` and `aliases` keep working.
- `[[Wikilinks]]`, `![[embeds]]`, `#tags` and callouts (`> [!note]`) convert, using Obsidian's rules
  to resolve links.
- Attachments are imported. `.obsidian/` and `.trash/` are skipped.

### From markdown files

Choose **Import markdown** for any folder of `.md` files. Relative links become page links, and
**CSV files become databases**.

### The import report

Every import ends with a report: how many pages, databases and files arrived, plus warnings (an
unresolved link, an unsupported syntax, a skipped file) and errors, each linked to the page it
affects.

## Export

Open **Export** from the page menu or the palette, choose what to export and in which format.

| Format                | Scope                         | What you get                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Markdown (zip)        | The workspace or a page tree  | Obsidian-compatible markdown with frontmatter, attachments alongside, and databases as CSV plus row pages. |
| JSON backup           | The workspace                 | Everything, exactly: all documents and files in a versioned format you can restore. |
| Markdown              | One page                      | A single `.md` file.                                                   |
| HTML                  | One page                      | A standalone, styled HTML file.                                        |
| PDF                   | One page                      | Through your system's print dialog.                                    |

Links export as `[[wikilinks]]` by default; choose relative markdown links if the tool you're
moving to prefers them.

## Backups

The **JSON backup** is the complete copy of a workspace. Restore it into a new workspace from
**Import**. Keep one somewhere safe from time to time, even if you sync to a server.

If you run a server, back up the server too: see [Backups and restore](../self-hosting/backups).

The desktop app can also keep a live markdown mirror of each workspace in its folder. See
[The desktop app](./desktop#markdown-mirror).
